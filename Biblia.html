A component can be rendered within any other component, or directly into the DOM if it's the topmost component, using
ReactDOM.render and providing it with both the component and the DOM Node where you want the React tree to be rendered:
/import React from 'react' import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' import Hello from './Hello'
ReactDOM.render(
<Hello name="Billy James" />, document.getElementById('main'))
// Import React and ReactDOM
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
// Render component into the DOM - only once per app
ReactDOM.render(
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
document.getElementById('root')
);

className -> To specify a CSS class, use the className attribute. This applies to all regular DOM and SVG elements like
<div>, <a>, and others. Aby określić klasę CSS, użyj atrybutu className. Dotyczy to wszystkich zwykłych elementów DOM i
        SVG, takich jak <div>, <a> i inne.



                If you use React with Web Components (which is uncommon), use the class attribute instead.

                ES6- Arrow functions are different way of creating functions in JavaScript. Besides(oprócz) a shorter
                syntax, they offer advantages when it comes to keeping the scope of the this keyworld.
                Arrow function syntax may look strange but it's actually simple.
                function callMe (name) {
                console.log(name);
                }
                Which you could also write as:
                const callMe = function(name) {
                console.log(name);
                }
                becomes:
                const callMe = (name) => {
                console.log(name);
                }
                Important:
                When having no arguments, you empty parentheses in the function declaration like:
                const callMe = () => {
                console.log('Tom!');
                }
                When having exactly one argument, you may omit the parentheses:
                const callMe = name => {
                console.log(name);
                }
                When returning a value, you can use the following shortcut;
                const returnMe = name => name
                That's equal to:
                const returnMe = name => {
                return name;
                }

                EXPORTS & IMPORTS
                In React projects (actually in all modern JavaScript projects), you split(rozdzielać) your code across
                multiple JavaScript files
                so-called modules. Do this, to keep each file(każdy plik)/module focused and manageable (moduł powinien
                być skupiony i łatwy w zarządzaniu.
                To still access functionality in another file, need export (to make it available and import (to get
                access) statements.
                Got two different types of exports: default(unnamed) and named exports:
                default=> export default ...;
                named => export const someData = ...;
                You can import default exports like this:
                import someNameOfYourChoice from './path/to/file.js';

                Surprisingly, someNameOfYourChoice is totally up to you.

                Named exports have to be imported by their name:

                import { someData } from './path/to/file.js';
                ?

                When importing named exports, you can also import all named exports at once with the following syntax:

                import * as upToYou from './path/to/file.js';

                upToYou is - well - up to you and simply bundles all exported variables/functions in one JavaScript
                object. For example, if you export const someData = ... (/path/to/file.js ) you can access it on
                upToYou like this: upToYou.someData .

                Classes
                Classes are a feature which basically replace constructor functions and prototypes. You can define
                blueprints for JavaScript objects with them.

                Like this:

                class Person {
                constructor () {
                this.name = 'Max';
                }
                }

                const person = new Person();
                console.log(person.name); // prints 'Max'
                In the above example, not only the class but also a property of that class (=> name ) is defined. The
                syntax you see there, is the "old" syntax for defining properties. In modern JavaScript projects (as
                the one used in this course), you can use the following, more convenient way of defining class
                properties:

                class Person {
                name = 'Max';
                }

                const person = new Person();
                console.log(person.name); // prints 'Max'
                You can also define methods. Either like this:

                class Person {
                name = 'Max';
                printMyName () {
                console.log(this.name); // this is required to refer to the class!
                }
                }

                const person = new Person();
                person.printMyName();
                Or like this:

                class Person {
                name = 'Max';
                printMyName = () => {
                console.log(this.name);
                }
                }

                const person = new Person();
                person.printMyName();
                The second approach has the same advantage as all arrow functions have: The this keyword doesn't change
                its reference.

                You can also use inheritance (dziedziczenie) when using classes:

                class Human {
                species = 'human';
                }

                class Person extends Human {
                name = 'Max';
                printMyName = () => {
                console.log(this.name);
                }
                }

                const person = new Person();
                person.printMyName();
                console.log(person.species); // prints 'human'

                Spread & Rest Operator
                The spread and rest operators actually use the same syntax: ...

                Yes, that is the operator - just three dots. It's usage determines whether you're using it as the
                spread or rest operator.

                Using the Spread Operator:

                The spread operator allows you to pull elements out of an array (=> split the array into a list of its
                elements) or pull the properties out of an object. Here are two examples:

                const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
                const newArray = [...oldArray, 4, 5]; // This now is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                Here's the spread operator used on an object:

                const oldObject = {
                name: 'Max'
                };
                const newObject = {
                ...oldObject,
                age: 28
                };
                newObject would then be

                {
                name: 'Max',
                age: 28
                }
                The spread operator is extremely useful for cloning arrays and objects. Since both are reference types
                (and not primitives), copying them safely (i.e. preventing future mutation of the copied original) can
                be tricky. With the spread operator you have an easy way of creating a (shallow!) clone of the object
                or array.

                Destructuring
                Destructuring allows you to easily access the values of arrays or objects and assign them to variables.

                Here's an example for an array:

                const array = [1, 2, 3];
                const [a, b] = array;
                console.log(a); // prints 1
                console.log(b); // prints 2
                console.log(array); // prints [1, 2, 3]
                And here for an object:

                const myObj = {
                name: 'Max',
                age: 28
                }
                const {name} = myObj;
                console.log(name); // prints 'Max'
                console.log(age); // prints undefined
                console.log(myObj); // prints {name: 'Max', age: 28}
                Destructuring is very useful when working with function arguments. Consider this example:

                const printName = (personObj) => {
                console.log(personObj.name);
                }
                printName({name: 'Max', age: 28}); // prints 'Max'
                Here, we only want to print the name in the function but we pass a complete person object to the
                function. Of course this is no issue but it forces us to call personObj.name inside of our function. We
                can condense this code with destructuring:

                const printName = ({name}) => {
                console.log(name);
                }
                printName({name: 'Max', age: 28}); // prints 'Max')
                We get the same result as above but we save some code. By destructuring, we simply pull out the name
                property and store it in a variable/ argument named name which we then can use in the function body.


                JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce() etc.

                You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in
                immutable ways).

                The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype -

                Components are the core building block of React apps. Actually, React really is just a library for
                creating components in its core.

                A typical React app therefore could be depicted as a component tree - having one root component ("App")
                and then an potentially infinite amount of nested child components.

                Each component needs to return/ render some JSX code - it defines which HTML code React should render
                to the real DOM in the end.

                JSX is NOT HTML but it looks a lot like it. Differences can be seen when looking closely though (for
                example className in JSX vs class in "normal HTML"). JSX is just syntactic sugar for JavaScript,
                allowing you to write HTMLish code instead of nested React.createElement(...) calls.

                When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:

                Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more
                about this later in the course) => const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> } (using ES6 arrow
                functions as shown here is recommended but optional)
                class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) => class
                Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } }
                We'll of course dive into the difference throughout this course, you can already note that you should
                use 1) as often as possible though. It's the best-practice.

                props and state are CORE concepts of React. Actually, only changes in props and/ or state trigger React
                to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser (a detailed look at how
                React checks whether to really touch the real DOM is provided in section 6).

                Props

                props allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.
                Rekwizyty umożliwiają przekazywanie danych z komponentu nadrzędnego (zawijanie) do komponentu potomnego
                (osadzonego).

                Example:

                AllPosts Component:

                const posts = () => {
                return (
                <div>
                    <Post title="My first Post" />
                </div>
                );
                }
                Here, title is the custom property (prop ) set up on the custom Post component. We basically replicate
                the default HTML attribute behavior we already know (e.g. <input type="text"> informs the browser about
                how to handle that input).

                Post Component:

                const post = (props) => {
                return (
                <div>
                    <h1>{props.title}</h1>
                </div>
                );
                }
                The Post component receives the props argument. You can of course name this argument whatever you want
                - it's your function definition, React doesn't care! But React will pass one argument to your component
                function => An object, which contains all properties you set up on
                <Post ... /> .

                {props.title} then dynamically outputs the title property of the props object - which is available
                since we set the title property inside AllPosts component (see above).



                State

                Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree (and hence trigger an UI update), state is
                used to change the component, well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update.
                Podczas gdy rekwizyty umożliwiają przekazywanie danych w dół drzewa komponentów (i tym samym wyzwalanie
                aktualizacji interfejsu użytkownika), stan jest używany do zmiany komponentu, dobrze, stan od wewnątrz.
                Zmiany stanu również powodują aktualizację interfejsu użytkownika.

                Example:

                NewPost Component:

                class NewPost extends Component { // state can only be accessed in class-based components!
                state = {
                counter: 1
                };

                render () { // Needs to be implemented in class-based components! Needs to return some JSX!
                return (
                <div>{this.state.counter}</div>
                );
                }
                }
                Here, the NewPost component contains state . Only class-based components can define and use state . You
                can of course pass the state down to functional components, but these then can't directly edit it.

                state simply is a property of the component class, you have to call it state though - the name is not
                optional. You can then access it via this.state in your class JSX code (which you return in the
                required render() method).

                Whenever state changes (taught over the next lectures), the component will re-render and reflect the
                new state. The difference to props is, that this happens within one and the same component - you don't
                receive new data (props ) from outside!

                In the last lecture, we saw that you can react to the onClick event - but to which other events can you
                listen? You can find a list of supported events here:

                onChange onInput onInvalid onSubmit
                For more information about the onChange event, see Forms.

                Mouse Events

                Event names:

                onClick onContextMenu onDoubleClick onDrag onDragEnd onDragEnter onDragExit
                onDragLeave onDragOver onDragStart onDrop onMouseDown onMouseEnter onMouseLeave
                onMouseMove onMouseOut onMouseOver onMouseUp
                The onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave events propagate from the element being left to the one being entered
                instead of ordinary bubbling and do not have a capture phase.

                When using create-react-app v2+ (you can check that by running create-react-app -V), support for CSS
                modules is already built-in!
                You don't need to eject then (though you still can - that won't be a problem). Instead, you can use CSS
                modules as described here:
                https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet

                CSS Modules are a relatively new concept (you can dive super-deep into them here:
                https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). With CSS modules, you can write normal CSS code and make
                sure, that it only applies to a given component.

                It's not using magic for that, instead it'll simply automatically generate unique CSS class names for
                you. And by importing a JS object and assigning classes from there, you use these dynamically
                generated, unique names. So the imported JS object simply exposes some properties which hold the
                generated CSS class names as values.

                Example:

                In Post.css File

                .Post {
                color: red;
                }
                In Post Component File

                import classes from './Post.css';

                const post = () => (
                <div className={classes.Post}>...</div>
                );
                Here, classes.Post refers to an automatically generated Post property on the imported classes object.
                That property will in the end simply hold a value like Post__Post__ah5_1 .

                So your .Post class was automatically transformed to a different class (Post__Post__ah5_1 ) which is
                unique across the application. You also can't use it accidentally in other components because you don't
                know the generated string! You can only access it through the classes object. And if you import the CSS
                file (in the same way) in another component, the classes object there will hold a Post property which
                yields a different (!) CSS class name. Hence it's scoped to a given component.

                By the way, if you somehow also want to define a global (i.e. un-transformed) CSS class in such a .css
                file, you can prefix the selector with :global .

                Example:

                :global .Post { ... }

                Now you can use className="Post" anywhere in your app and receive that styling.

                How to use the downloaded files

                1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
                2) Run "npm start" to view the project

                Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/
                into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a
                different create-react-app version) and still use my code.
